            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Christ the wisedome of God induceth his disciples to a perfection in this holinesse: saying,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.48.</note>
               <hi>Ye shal ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be perfect, euen as your father which is in heauen is perfect.</hi> That is, ye shall so nie resemble in holinesse your father in heauen, as it is possible for a similitude to represent liuely the thing it selfe, wherof it is a similitude. And that no man deceiue himselfe,
<pb facs="tcp:14989:4"/>imagining this holinesse to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red onely of the Cleargie men, and not of all Christians, it is apparant by the testimonies afore cited, as well of Moses, as the Apostles, to be required of so many, as will haue the Lord to be their God. Neither did Christ induce his Apostles onely vnto that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in holinesse, but also his disciples: betw√©ene whome &amp; the Apostles was like difference, as now betw√©ene the Cleargie and Laitie. S√©eing then our God exacteth of vs all holines, which is a practize of the knowledge of his will (his will being, we leaue vndoone the euill he forbiddeth, and doo the good he commandeth: and that of these two partes consisteth true repentaunce) to induce the rather thereunto, I haue thought good to set before our eyes a pattern of vnfained repentance. And that after our repentaunce we may take h√©ede of falling, I minde by the helpe of God, out of the same place of Scripture, which I euen now read, first to speake of the fall, then of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing againe of Peter. In whose fall
<pb facs="tcp:14989:4"/>we haue to consider these thr√©e circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: first of the person, secondly of the euill whereinto he fell, thirdly of the occasion.</p>
            <p>The holy Ghost by the Euangelists dooth witnes vnto vs, that Peter was he who fell. An elect and chosen vessel: called of Christ to be an Apostle: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the mouth of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe blessed: made partaker of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes: who in heart bel√©eued,<note place="margin">Matt. 16.16.</note> and in mouth had confessed Christ to b√©e the sonne of the liuing God:<note place="margin">Luk. 22.21.</note> for whome Christ prayed, that whƒì Satan should syft him, his faith might not fayle: who entirely loued Christ, and was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him. This fall of Saint Peter and other the saintes and friendes of God, set downe in the scriptures, is not therefore that we shoulde vse the same as a cloke to couer our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, hyding the candle vnder the bed,<note place="margin">Mar. 4.21.</note> which should be set vpon a candlestick, measuring the scriptures by our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualitie: but to this ende that we s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our owne frailtie and the enemie his power, may walke more warely
<pb facs="tcp:14989:5"/>and treade more sure. And if it so be, we doo fall grieuously, we yet dispaire not, but by the same meanes endeuour to rise againe as they did.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.14.</note> Our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie appeareth in this, that we can not perceiue the things that are of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,<note place="margin">Sapi. 9.15.</note> this corruptible bodie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heauie vnto the soule, &amp; the earthly mansion keeping downe the mynde that is full of cares. If we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the good, much lesse can we doo it. If we be not able,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.5.</note> as of our selues, to thinke any good thought, much lesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring foorth any good action: as such in whome by nature dwelleth no good thing.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.18. Ezechi. 15.3.</note> But as the wood of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifyed vine tree serueth not to vse, no not so much as a pinne to be made of the wood thereof, to hang any vessell thereon, but onely is matter for the fire: So we of our selues dry rotten wood, are onely m√©ete for euerlasting fire. And although (our knowledge and iudgement b√©eing cleared by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God) we be able sometimes to discerne betw√©ene good and euill, yet by reason of this body of sinne which
<pb facs="tcp:14989:5"/>we carrie about with vs, w√©e are for the most part drawne away from the good which wee lyke, vnto the euill which we would not doo. Yea so, that if with a thousand things God shoulde charge euen the best of vs,<note place="margin">Iob. 9.3. Psal. 130.3. Psal. 143.2.</note> we shoulde not be able to answere to one. If the Lorde should looke straightly what is doone amisse, who shoulde be able to stand? If the Lorde should enter into iudgement with vs, none could in his sight be iustified. To euill there are many wayes, to good onely one way. Euery vertue hath two extremes, and eche extreme, euill. To man to walke so straightly betw√©ene the extremes, that he doo not at sometime or other decline eyther to the right hande or to the left, it is not giuen. In naturall things it is hard to enioy the good, but we shall also at sometime taste of the euill. The fire comforteth vs with warmth, the extreme heate therof vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs. The ayre when it is temperate dooth refreshe, but violent it br√©edeth passions. The waters bring commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, but annoy vs when they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowe
<pb facs="tcp:14989:6"/>their Chanels. Too much meate br√©edeth indigestion, too little maketh y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bodie weake. Want of exercise br√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth sicknesse, too much labour is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Solitarines maketh vs incline to melancholie, and too much conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is importunate. Riches are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with care, and pouertie subiect to sorrow. Of these and such like hee that will suck the sw√©ete, must nowe and then taste of the sowre. Euerie commoditie bringing with it the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie. The Grecians prayse Hercules for his force, but they accuse him of tyrannie. The Lacedemonians attribute much to Lycurgus for his zeale to his Countrie: but they note him of rigorous seueritie, with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians <hi>Isis</hi> is famous for patience, but condemned for vnchastitie. The Athenians extol <hi>Plato</hi> for his doctrine: but they carpe his vnsatiable coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse. The Romanes make <hi>Caesar</hi> to bee mercifull: and with all report him hautie &amp; proude. <hi>Homer</hi> in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge excellent: in speache vaine. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Great of noble courage:
<pb facs="tcp:14989:6"/>yet to him remaineth a perpetuall blot of infamie, that in his furie he slewe <hi>Clitus</hi> his dearest friende. <hi>Haniball</hi> of minde inuincible: yet stained with periurie. <hi>Traian</hi> a milde, gentle, and iust Prince: yet a wine bibber. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius</hi> aboue all for his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: yet amorous. So that I may well conclude that as there is no bread without branne, no nut without shel, no tr√©e without barke, no corne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chaffe, no garden without w√©edes, no Wine without l√©es, no golde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drosse: so no wyght that liueth hath lyued, or shall liue, onelye man, without sinne. The caution standeth in this, that for the vertue we allowe not the vice: nor for the vice, condemne the vertue, obscuring the glory of God in his creatures: but rather that wee knowe to discerne betw√©ene the good and the euill: mislyking the euill to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyde it, liking the good to doo it. From the dooing which good the farther w√©e s√©e our selues of, touching our owne power, the more we haue to striue, to take h√©ede, and to watche: especially
<pb facs="tcp:14989:7"/>s√©eing to this our weakenesse, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doth oppose his strength. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, hauing had a proofe thereof in himselfe compareth him vnto a Lyon,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.8.</note> and not onely vnto a Lyon for his strength, but to a roaring Lyon for his greedinesse to deuour. The Lyon then roareth when he is pynched with hunger: and beyng hunger bytten, whatsoeuer is in his way prayable, he taketh his pray on it. And this his gr√©edines is continual. He iudgeth all labour lost, saue that he taketh in wo≈´<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the soule of man. As Naab the Ammonite warring against the men of Iabes Gilead woulde not rayse his siege but vpon condition,<note place="margin">1. Sam, 11.2.</note> that he might thrust out all their right eyes: so this enemie neuer ceaseth to assault vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he haue depriued vs of the eye of right iudgement, that we s√©e not our saluation in Christ Iesu onely. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God by grace strengthen vs that we y√©elde not so farre, yet let vs knowe that the enemie vpon no other condition rayseth siege. If man b√©e weake, the enemie strong, the way

A man that is through sicknesse or age impotent, s√©eing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes the young lustie, and strong man through slabbinesse of the way, &amp; violence of the winds throwne downe, he taketh him to his staffe, and treadeth more surely. If Moses the faythfull fell in infidelitie: Dauid the holyest became prophane: Salomon the wisest committed so great sollies: and Peter the louingst, denied his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. If the Saintes and deare friends of God haue fallen before our eyes, let vs lay aside trust in our owne strƒìgth, let vs tread sure, leane vnto our staffe, haue affiance in our God. Let vs not take their fall to be our standing, but rather by them measure our selues, &amp; the guilt of our sinnes, gathering as it were the whole Lyon by the pawe: let vs rise with them by repentaunce: let vs sorow with them for our sinnes: let
<pb facs="tcp:14989:8"/>vs with them perswade our selues of God his mercie in Christ Iesu: let vs with them take sure holde of that his mercy by stedfast hope: let vs be raised by repentaunce, take h√©ede with them we fall not againe. Nowe let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the fall.</p>
            <p>But he denyed it, saying: <hi>I knowe him not.)</hi> The Euangelistes doo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that Peter denyed his maister thr√©e times. To lie in any case is euil, the circumstances, as of cause, maner, time, place, and person doo aggrauate the euill. To fall therein once is not without daunger, to fall the seconde time bruiseth sore: to fall the thirde time, woundeth d√©epe. To sinne, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh God: to adde sinne to sinne kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth him more: to heape them one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others necke, asketh present venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. If to lye be sinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> and sinne haue for the rewarde death: &amp; that to sweare falsely is more then simply to lye: and by curse for a man to deuote himselfe be more gr√©euous then falsly to sweare (That being the most perilous kinde of swearing (as S. Augustine sayeth)<note place="margin">in Psal. 7.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:14989:8"/>which is ioyned with a curse: as if I should say, the Lorde so iudge me as I haue doone in this) how gr√©euous was this fall of Peter, who not onely deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Lord, once, againe, and the third time: but sware he neuer knewe him: and as it were, betooke himselfe vnto the deuill if euer he knewe him? And that dooth aggrauate the fault most of al, he did it knowing him to be, as mƒÅ, so God: hauing before confessed that he was Christ the sonne of the liuing God. Thus denyed he his maister, his God, his saluation, wittingly, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, euen against the testimonie of his owne conscience. Willingly I sayde that no mƒÅ thinke he did it against his will, for although he came not thither with will to denie him, yet when he sawe the daunger, and yeelded to the reason of flesh &amp; blood, he was brought to will that which otherwise he would not. H√©ere may we s√©e a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tw√©ene the sinne wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly done against the conscience, and the sinne against the holy Ghost. Not euery sinne committed against the
<pb facs="tcp:14989:9"/>conscience, is that sinne which Christ sayeth shall not be forgiuen neither in this worlde nor in the world to come:<note place="margin">Matt. 12.32. Mark. 3.29.</note> that is, as S. Marke expo≈´deth it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: but this is the sinne neuer to be forgiuen, which is committed to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe the trueth as wittingly, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly against the testimonie of the conscience, so also malitiously, ioyning handes of set purpose with the enemy to extinguish the spirit, to deface the honour, and to obscure the glory of God. It may yet more plainly appeare if we oppose vnto Peter Iulian the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postata. Peter denyed Christ in the same sort and maner, as is aforesayde Iulian denied. The one his heart was mollified to repentance: the other his heart hardened. Wherefore? The one denied of frailtie: the other of malice, The one for feare of death: y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> other of selfe will desirous to powre out hys poyson against the Church of God, not mooued thereunto eyther by feare of Magistrate, bitternesse of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or terrour of death, as hee who was Lord, King, &amp; Emperour, ruling
<pb facs="tcp:14989:9"/>all, not ruled by any. The one denyed that he knewe him, but spake no euill of him: the other abandoned the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell as wicked, speaking euill both of Christ and it. The one did it sodainly and at a push: the other deliberately. The one in a corner: the other in set and open iudgement. The one, though he forsooke his master, yet serued he no idoles: The other not onely forsooke Christ, but serued the deuill. This his sinne so malitiously c≈çmitted, set such a stoppe and shut such a bolt betw√©ene the grace of God and his conscience, that hauing receiued his deaths wo≈´d, whether by a man (as some thinke) or by an Angell (as others write) or by a deuill (as we also reade) thrusting his hand into his wound, he tooke forth an handfull of blood, and sprinckled it in the ayre with these wordes <hi>Vicisti Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee, vicisti.</hi> O thou Galilean (so he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Christ) thou hast ouercome, thou hast ouercome. Notwithstanding he confessed the power of Christ euen in the instant of death, yet could he not call for grace, nor cry for mercie. This
<pb facs="tcp:14989:10"/>haue I spoken, not to extenuate the fal of Peter, which was horrible, but partly, that we take h√©ede of that great sinne against the holy Ghost which is irremisible, &amp; partly, to the comfort of the afflicted conscience of such as are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise gr√©euously fallen. Peter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he denied his master at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first, yet did he not at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first eyther sweare or curse. Wherby we may see how the deuill when he hath by sin taken hold, dooth lead man, as it were by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hand, from one sin to another, from y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> great to the greater, vntill he haue brought him to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fulnes of sin to wallow in the same with securitie &amp; contempt. After y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same maner he inwrappeth vs now adayes. First vnder colour of recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he bringeth in dice and cardes.

            <p>The occasion of his fall depended partly of himselfe, partly of the damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
<pb facs="tcp:14989:11"/>and others the seruauntes of the high priest, and partly of the place. Of himselfe, in that he presumed so much in his owne strength, that he thought himselfe sure.

With this vertue this Damosell was not acquainted: and therfore without blushing she rusheth in amongst the thickest, charging Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: not taking repulse with his first deniall, she assaulteth him the seconde time. Sh√©e sawe Christ the innocent
<pb facs="tcp:14989:14"/>Lambe shamefully intreated: yea in maner sh√©e sawe the lamentable end√© that woulde ensue. And yet as her mate the daughter of Herodias coulde with drye eyes beholde the heade of John the Baptist in the Platter all imbrewed with blood:<note place="margin">Mat. 14.11,</note> so she voyde of all compassion, could behold that dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spectacle with gladnesse.

Now let vs diligently note his rising agayne. Wherein wee haue to obserue these two thinges. First the meanes by which he was induced to repentance: secondly, howe hee behaued himselfe therein. The meanes the Euangelist noteth to bee externall and internall. The externall &amp; outward meane was the crowing of the cocke: the internall and inwarde meane was, that Iesus looked vpon him, which looke was not of the corporal eye, but spiritual grace: Christ and Peter beyng by place dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuered. Both these to the conuerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Peter did concurre. It cannot be that he who is ouercome by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and swallowed vp of sinne, shoulde come againe to himselfe and repent, vnlesse by some meanes occasion be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen wherby he may be stirred to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction. But the best meanes is with the Lorde his looke, the sounde of the Cocke. This sounde or voyce of the
<pb facs="tcp:14989:16"/>Cocke is the preaching of the worde: which sounding in our eares (if Iesus with all looke on vs) dooth so awake vs that were in the dead sl√©epe of sinne, as the noise of the Cocke in the dead time of the night, dooth awake out of sl√©epe. And this is the direct and ordinarie meanes which God hath appointed to saue all those by,<note place="margin">1. Cor, 1.21.</note> that shall bel√©eue. Whereof we haue manifest examples in the Actes of the Apostles.<note place="margin">Acts. 8.8.</note> The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuche chiefe gouernour to Candace Qu√©ene of the Ethiopians, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Hierusalem, where h√©e had worshipped, sitting in his chariot, read Esay the Prophet.

               </note> The sorowe in Peter great, argueth his loue to be great. And although it can not be but that the consideration of the due reward of sinne, that is, of eternall death and paines of hell, doo worke so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the heart, yet in the children of God the greatest sorow is, in that they haue prouoked so mercifull and louing a God. And therefore euen after they are risen againe by repentaunce, and
<pb facs="tcp:14989:26"/>haue by saith bel√©eaed, and by hope ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken holde of God his mercie in Christ Iesu, the fall remembred, the heart so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth. Which sorow then can not by any meanes proc√©ede of feare, of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, but of loue of God. This loue maketh vs (if we be of God) both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and abhorre y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> euill, as that which prouoketh our God: and to desire to ensue the good, as that we knowe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleasant in his sight. Of which two partes consisteth true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. It being after the Hebrewe word, a turning vnto God: after the Gr√©eke word, a chaunge of mind, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and d√©ede: after the Latines, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling of our selues home, or a recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the pristine health of the minde after folly or madnesse. Whereby it apparantly resteth in eschewing euill, and doyng good: in turning from the deuill vnto God: in chaunge of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, abhorring now that which before with pleasure we hunted after: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home againe into our selues with deuise and studie to amende the euill committed. (Repentance hauing
<pb facs="tcp:14989:27"/>respect not is the minde and purpose alone, but also vnto the d√©ede.) The roote of it is faith which (if it be of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie) hath alwayes adioyued vnto it vehement griefe, sorow, and feares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant. H√©ere may we s√©e wherein the repentance of the godly and of the wicked dooth differ. The very repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate (as is manifest in the example of Iudas) haue in them after the euill committed, both confessi≈ç of the fault, and sorowe of the heart. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, for that it proc√©edeth not of faith, is not accepted with God. <hi>Whom without faith it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to please.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6. Rom. 14.23</note>
               <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of faith being sinne.</hi> The repentaunce which is in the children of God is therefore of efficacie, because it contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not onely the confession of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fault with vehement sorowe of the heart: but also a willing chaunge of minde and life in conuersion vnto God, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to and with an assured perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pardon and forgiuenesse, through the fauour &amp; mercy of God in Christ. The end being the honour of God and
<pb facs="tcp:14989:27"/>our saluation.

               <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> assigneth this for a speciall marke, when we doo not onely repent the euill doone, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so gladly suffer whatsoeuer pleaseth God to lay vpon vs for the same, lyke vnto the children of Israel, which saide vnto the Lorde, we haue sinned:<note place="margin">Indie. 10.15.</note> doo thou vnto vs whatsoeuer pleaseth th√©e. To drawe nowe to an ende, since after shipwracke which we haue all made, the best and surest, yea the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hauen, is repentance, that it may be
<pb facs="tcp:14989:28"/>true, not counterfeit: profitable vnto vs, not hurtfull: acceptable in God his fight, not odious: let vs not snatch at it and go our wayes, but to the ful qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting and setling of our consciences, take with vs so much as is of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that by it we may with Peter b√©e saued, &amp; not with Iudas condemned. Wee haue therefore to acknowledge our fall and confesse our sinnes: to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe bitterly in heart for the same: to submit our selues vnder the mightie hand of God, contented to suffer what soeuer he shall lay vpon vs, willingly to turne vnto God through chaunge not onely of minde and purpose, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of life (if God giue time:) Assuredly to perswade our selues that whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we shall this doo, he who by iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (that I may vse Tertullian his words) hath appointed paine,<note place="margin">De poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia.</note> hath by mercy promised pard≈ç to al our sins: howe many or great soeuer, whether in will or d√©ede, in flesh or spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

               <hi>and

All his transgressions that he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they shall not be mentioned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. For the Lorde reteyneth not his wrath for euer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mich. 7.18.</note>
               <hi>because mercie pleaseth him. He will turne againe &amp; haue compassion vpon vs, he wil sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our iniquities, and cast all our sinnes into the bottome of the Sea.</hi> This if we shall truely doo to the ende to honour God by rising againe to good life, whome by our fall into euill w√©e had dishonoured, then shall we, not of merit, but of mercy, eschew death the reward of sinne, and inioy eternal life the gift of God, through Iesus Christ our Lord: vnto whom with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the holy spirit bee all praise and glory now and for euer.
